      <p>The butterless biscuits for these Benedicts are perfect for kids to make because they are so simple. For little
        and big kids: Let them help with measuring, mixing and cutting out the biscuits and making the eggless
        hollandaise.</p>
      <ul>Ingredients
        <li>Biscuits:</li>
        <li>120g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>170g fresh goat cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>240ml heavy cream, plus more for brushing</li>
        <li>Quick Hollandaise:</li>
        115g mayonnaise
        1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
        1/8 teaspoon paprika
        Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
        8 slices Canadian bacon
        8 large eggs
      </ul>
      <p class="textfont">Method
        For the biscuits: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 220 degrees C. Line a baking
        sheet with parchment.
        Whisk together the flour, chives, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add the goat cheese, and toss,
        using your hands to break it up into pea-sized pieces. Add the cream, and mix with a wooden spoon until
        combined. Let the dough stand for 5 minutes.
        Roll the dough out into a round that is slightly less than 1/2 inch thick. Cut out 8 biscuits with a 2 1/2-inch
        round cookie cutter, and arrange them about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Brush them with more
        cream, and sprinkle with a little salt. Bake the biscuits until just golden, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer them to
        a wire rack, and let cool. When the biscuits are cool enough to handle, split them in half. Put 2 bottom halves
        on each of 4 plates.
        For the quick hollandaise: Whisk the mayonnaise, lemon juice, paprika and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl,
        and season with salt and pepper; set aside.
        Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the bacon in batches until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per
        side. Place 1 slice of bacon on each biscuit bottom, folding if needed.
        Bring a wide pot with about 2 inches of water to a very gentle simmer. Break the eggs into the water, spacing
        them apart. Cover the pot, and turn off the heat. After 2 to 3 minutes the whites should be set and the yolks
        still soft. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, and place on top of the Canadian bacon slices. Drizzle with
        hollandaise, sprinkle with chives and sandwich each with a biscuit top
